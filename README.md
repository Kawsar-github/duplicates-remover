MaDe wiTH LovE BY YOuRs "Kawsar Sikder"

1. Download the .py file
2. Open up the terminal/cmd on that directory
3. Then execute by typing "python filename.py" [Make sure you have python installed on your device]
[Sometimes you have to type "python3" rather than "python" in the terminal/command]
4. When everything goes well it will ask for the location [e.g. home/downloads/myfiles][Always use "/" slash]
5. After inserting location watch the magic happens.[Give it some time to scan...note that it will make md5 so bigger the file better the time]
6. After the scanning it will show you the duplicates files and their number and which file it will keep4u [At that time you can check your files too if that is a duplicate]
7. After that it will ask if you want to remove duplicates(Y/n) Give "y/Y" to remove duplicates or "n/N" to stop/exit the .py file
8. If you choose (Y/y) it will remove those duplicates and then exit
9. Enjoy
